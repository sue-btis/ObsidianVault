# ⚡ Boosting Methods in Machine Learning

## 📌 What is Boosting?

**Boosting** is an ensemble learning method that builds a strong model by combining multiple **weak learners**, usually decision trees. The learners are trained **sequentially**, and each new model tries to correct the mistakes of the previous one.

> 🎯 Boosting focuses on learning from the **errors** of prior models to improve performance.

## 🔁 Boosting vs Bagging

| Feature         | Bagging (e.g. Random Forest)   | Boosting (e.g. AdaBoost, GBM) |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Training Style  | Parallel                         | Sequential                    |
| Model Type      | Usually same base learners       | Can be varied                 |
| Focus           | Reducing variance                | Reducing bias                 |
| Data Sampling   | Yes (with replacement)           | No                            |

# ⚡ Classical Boosting Methods

## 1. 🔸 AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)

AdaBoost increases the weight of incorrectly predicted samples and reduces the weight of correctly predicted ones after each round.

### 🔍 How it Works
1. Start with equal weights for all samples.
2. Train a weak learner.
3. Increase weights of incorrectly predicted samples.
4. Add the learner to the ensemble.
5. Final prediction = **weighted majority vote** or sum.

### 🔧 AdaBoost in Python

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

model = AdaBoostClassifier(
    base_estimator=DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1),
    n_estimators=50,
    learning_rate=1.0,
    random_state=42
)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## 2. 🔸 Gradient Boosting

Gradient Boosting fits each new learner to the **residual errors** (gradients) of the previous model.

### 🔍 How it Works
1. Make an initial prediction.
2. Calculate residuals.
3. Train a new learner to predict residuals.
4. Combine predictions using a learning rate.
5. Repeat for `n_estimators` rounds.

### 🔧 Gradient Boosting in Python

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor

model = GradientBoostingRegressor(
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    max_depth=3,
    random_state=42
)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

# 🚀 Modern Boosting Techniques

Modern libraries improve boosting performance with smarter algorithms and better resource usage.

## 3. 🐍 XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

XGBoost is an optimized version of gradient boosting that supports parallelism, regularization, and missing value handling.

### ✅ Highlights
- Regularization (L1 & L2)
- Missing value handling
- Fast and scalable
- Early stopping support

### 🔧 Example

```python
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

model = XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    use_label_encoder=False,
    eval_metric='logloss'
)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## 4. 💡 LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)

LightGBM is optimized for large datasets using histogram-based algorithms.

### ✅ Highlights
- Very fast and memory efficient
- Supports categorical features directly
- Works well on high-dimensional data

### 🔧 Example

```python
import lightgbm as lgb

train_data = lgb.Dataset(X_train, label=y_train)

params = {
    'objective': 'binary',
    'metric': 'binary_logloss',
    'learning_rate': 0.1
}

model = lgb.train(params, train_data, num_boost_round=100)
```

## 5. 🧠 CatBoost

CatBoost, developed by Yandex, is ideal for datasets with **many categorical features**.

### ✅ Highlights
- Handles categorical variables natively
- High accuracy with little tuning
- Built-in support for visualization and interpretation

### 🔧 Example

```python
from catboost import CatBoostClassifier

model = CatBoostClassifier(verbose=0)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
